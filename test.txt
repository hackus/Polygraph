It's the celestial equivalent of a horror film adversary: a star that just wouldn't stay dead.
When most stars go supernova, they die in a single blast, but astronomers have found a star that survived not one, but five separate explosions.
The "zombie" star kept erupting for nearly two years - six times longer than the duration of a typical supernova.
An international team details their results in the academic journal Nature.
"This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work. It's the biggest puzzle I've encountered in almost a decade of studying stellar explosions," said co-author Iair Arcavi, a postdoctoral fellow at Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) who is based in California.
The mysterious object, iPTF14hls, was picked up in September 2014 by a wide-field camera astronomy survey.
Astronomers identified it as an exploding star in January 2015; everything about the discovery seemed normal at first.
In common types of supernova, a blast at the centre of the star ejects material at high speed into surrounding space. The expansion of this material releases energy, causing the object to shine brightly for up to 100 days (about four months) before it finally fades.
It soon became clear this exploding star wasn't conforming to expectations. For one thing, it didn't fade, but shone brightly for 600 days - nearly two years.
